## Overview and Origin

* Check

* Founded 2019

* Andrew Brown, Vivek Patel, Eric Stromberg

* Check was started because it’s too hard to run payroll. While vertical SaaS platforms, workforce management apps, and labor marketplaces have made front-office operations radically simpler for businesses large and small, almost none of these providers have been able to offer payroll to their customers.

* Current funding: PE/VC -- $119M


## Business Activities:

> * *"If you know anything about payroll, you know it’s complex. With over 13,000 taxes across the country, payroll has been too daunting for platforms to build and manage. This challenge has left their customers — business owners — with clunky, one-size-fits-all payroll software that lives outside their operating system."* 


Check works with industry-leading software platforms across vertical SaaS, workforce management, and innovative labor marketplaces.

* Check is B2B, or even B2B2B. Companies build on top of Check's API to develop their own, customizable payroll solution. The benefits of this payroll solution allow SMBs to have more control with great upside and very little downside risk. Check has offered a new path in the build, buy, partner paradigm allowing its customers to build at a fraction of the cost and with significanty less effort. In terms of marke size, payroll is close to $9 trillion in annual volume in the U.S. alone.

* Other major companies/competitors in this payroll specific domain:
    * ADP
    * Workday
    * Gusto
    * Namely
    * syncHR


## Results

* Check has the ability to fulfill the payroll space the same way that Stripe fulfilled the payments space. Already, the company has stepped into this role for large businesses like Homebase, Procare, and ServiceTitan. By doing so, Check touches hundreds of thousands of small businesses, growing rapidly. 

It is not hard to imagine how that number could reach millions. There are hundreds of platforms that seem well-suited to Check’s offering.

## Core Metrics in Payroll Domain

Core metrics used by payroll firms in this domain include:

* Number of Errors/Accuracy Rate
* Overtime
* Time to Run Payroll
* Cost of Payroll/Cost per Payroll Payment
* Labor Expense as a Percentage of Total Revenue

Going back to the main options firms have available to implement a payroll service, they can either buy, build, or partner in order to provide integral payroll services. Each of those options come with its own unique benefits and costs. Determining the costs to implement your desired strategy and its corresponding ROI is crucial for providing your firm with the most beneficial payroll solution. Check provides the best of both worlds by allowing firms to have more flexibilty, ideally increasing ROI, and cutting down on the implementation costs.

## Competitive Landscape

Check's unique approach providing more customization allows for its offering suite to be more attractive than most of its competitors' static solutions. Performance is a little hard to ascertain due to Check's infancy with under 250 employees and estimates of ~$5M in annual revenues. However, as is described above the outlook for Check looks very promising.


## Recommendations

The biggest impediment to Check's future success is the stickiness of payroll in general.

> * *"This past weekend I was chatting with a founder of an early-stage startup. When I asked what he thought of his payroll provider, he said, quickly, that he hated it. When I asked if he’d ever switch, he responded just as rapidly, “no way.” " -- Andrew Brown*

That is a perfect example of how ADP and Workday continue to realize such great market share in this space. Customer satisfaction remains low however the costs of switching and the work necessary to implement  new payroll solutions deter prospective customers. Because Check's product speaks for itself and is relatively easy to implement, my only recommendation for Check is to heavily market their product via the existing partnership channels. By obtaining customer lists from Homebase,Shopify, ServiceTitan, Ramp, etc. and automating weekly emails, Check can market their proprietary payroll solutions to startups and SMBs. Python can identify new companies onboarded to any of the partner firms and immediately send an email proposing a demo of Check's capabilities. Currenty Check has the benefit of providing the most robust payroll solution, however overtime this concept will be replicated and offered by competitors which is why it is crucial for Check to aquire as many customers as possible while it continues to grow. The CAC (customer aquisition cost) associated with the deployment of the python program to identify and push emails to prospective clients is inexpensive and will prove to be highly effective. Once Check has these customers onboarded they will realize the true benefits Check provides in terms of its state of the art payroll API.
